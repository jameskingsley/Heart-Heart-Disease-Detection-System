# Heart-Disease-Detection-System

This project is a machine learning-based predictive system designed to assess the risk of heart disease in patients. Using key health indicators such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and chest pain type, the system leverages a trained model to predict the likelihood of heart disease. Built with Streamlit and joblib, the application offers a user-friendly interface for real-time predictions.
